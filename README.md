**Employee Retention Analysis**

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of employee retention using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify whether an employee is likely to leave or stay based on various factors such as satisfaction level, evaluation scores, number of projects, average monthly hours, tenure, work accidents, promotions, department, and salary.

**Key Features:**

- Exploratory data analysis and visualization of employee retention patterns
- Clustering analysis to identify employee segments based on satisfaction level and average monthly hours
- Decision tree classifier for predicting employee attrition
- Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step implementation and explanations

**Dataset:**

The analysis is based on the HR analytics dataset, which includes information on employees' characteristics and whether they have left the company.

**Dependencies:**

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
